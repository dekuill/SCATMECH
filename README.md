# SCATMECH: Polarized Light Scattering C++ Class Library

SCATMECH is an object-oriented C++ class library developed to distribute models for light scattering applications.
Included in the library are models for diffuse surface scattering that predict the bidirectional reflectance 
distribution function (BRDF), codes for calculating scattering by isolated particles, and codes for reflection, 
transmission, and diffraction from gratings. Emphasis has been given to those diffuse scatter models that are 
physics-based and which predict the polarization properties of the scattered light. The library also includes 
a number of classes that are useful for working with polarized light or the optics of thin films. The library 
is designed to enable expansion of new models.
